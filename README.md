# Global Superstore Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

The Global Superstore dataset is a popular business dataset used to simulate a retail chain's operations globally. My Tableau dashboard provides insights into:

- Sales and profit performance across regions and categories
- Customer segment behavior and profitability
- Top-performing countries and cities
- Order trends by shipping mode and date

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Regional Performance**: Significant variation in profitability and sales volume across continents.
- **Product Category Analysis**: Technology outperformed Furniture and Office Supplies in revenue generation.
- **Shipping Trends**: Standard Class was the most common shipping mode, but not always the most profitable.
- **Customer Segments**: Corporate and Consumer segments showed distinct purchase behaviors across regions.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Tableau Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboard development.
- **Dataset**: [Global Superstore](./Global%20superstore%20dashboard.twbx) (TWBX Tableau Workbook)

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- 📌 **Dashboard Design & Layout**: Built user-friendly dashboards with cohesive layouts and intuitive navigation.
- 🔎 **Interactive Filtering**: Applied filters by Region, Segment, Category, and Ship Mode to enhance data exploration.
- 🗺 **Geographic Visualization**: Created map views to analyze sales and profit across countries.
- 📊 **KPI Indicators**: Designed dynamic KPIs to track performance metrics (Sales, Profit, Orders).
- 🎨 **Visual Best Practices**: Used color coding, tooltips, and chart types (bar, line, heatmap, scatter) to enhance clarity.
- 🧮 **Calculated Fields & Aggregates**: Created custom fields for profit ratios, rankings, and moving averages.
- ⚙️ **Parameter Usage**: Added user controls to toggle between views and metrics.
- 🔄 **Data Hierarchies**: Enabled drill-down from Region > Country > City for deeper analysis.
